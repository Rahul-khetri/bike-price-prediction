# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **resale price of a used bike** based on multiple factors such as brand, model year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more. It leverages **Python and Machine Learning algorithms** to analyze the dataset and estimate accurate prices for used bikes.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to help users determine the **approximate market value of a used bike** using historical data and predictive modeling.  
It involves **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.
